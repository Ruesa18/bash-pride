# bash-pride

## What is 'bash-pride'?
The bash-pride project introduces a new command for Linux. It's basically a bash script that allows you to show your pride! 🏳️‍🌈😃

## Credits
I have been inspired by [this repository](https://github.com/ExperiBass/cli-pride-flags) of [ExperiBass](https://github.com/ExperiBass).
It's a good solution, but I wanted to be able to scale it and also use it as terminal welcome screen (bashrc).
